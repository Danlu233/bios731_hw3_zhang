1. source folder contains R functions used in the analysis:
    - 01_simulate_data.R: Simulates the dataset.
    - 02_apply_methods.R: Applies linear regression to the simulated data and do nonparametric bootstrap.
    - 03_extract_estimates.R: Extracts estimates and calculates Wald confidence intervals and bootstrap percentile intervals.

2. simulation folder contains the script that runs the simulation using the functions from the source Folder:
   - run_simulation.R: This script calls the functions in the Source Folder to perform the simulation.
   - run_sim.sh: Sbatch script for running run_simulation.R on cluster.

3. data folder stores the simulation results by scenario. The results generated by run_simulation.R are saved here.

4. analysis folder contains code for exploring the simulation results and generating the final report:
   - exploratory_analysis.R: Scripts for exploratory analysis of the simulation results, generating tables and figures.
   - final_report.Rmd: Code for generating final report.

5. result folder stores the tables and figures generated from the exploratory analysis. These files are used in the final report.
